Code Summary:

Age-Survival Analysis: Utilizes box plots and histograms to explore the impact of age on survival, revealing age groups associated with different survival outcomes.

Nodes-Survival Analysis: Investigates the relationship between the number of nodes and survival using box plots, histograms, and a joint plot.

Year-Survival Analysis: Includes a box plot to analyze the influence of the year on survival.

Age-Nodes Analysis: Explores the joint distribution of age and nodes to uncover patterns in survival.

Year-Nodes Analysis: Visualizes the relationship between the year and nodes using a box plot.

Age-Year Analysis: Utilizes a joint plot to examine the joint distribution of age and year.
